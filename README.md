# WorldCupFixture

## Functions to have:
* Choose the winners of each game and previsualize the hypothetic fixtures
* Show the information of each match: Date and hour, stadium, phase, etc.
* Select the matches to follow and deliver a calendar file to add to your calendar.
* Export the hypothetical fixture and sum the total points (matches with correct guesses of winner/ties)
* Have an information page for each team (not really important)
